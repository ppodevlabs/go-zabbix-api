/*
Package zabbix provides bindings to interoperate between programs written in Go
language and the Zabbix monitoring API.

Tested on Zabbix 3.2 but should work since 2.0 version.
This package aims to support multiple zabbix resources from its API like trigger, application, host group, host, item, template..

Install it: `go get github.com/ppodevlabs/go-zabbix-api`

Getting started

	package main

	import (
		"fmt"

		"github.com/ppodevlabs/go-zabbix-api"
	)

	func main() {
		user := "MyZabbixUsername"
		pass := "MyZabbixPassword"
		api := zabbix.NewAPI("http://localhost/api_jsonrpc.php")
		api.Login(user, pass)

		res, err := api.Version()
		if err != nil {
			panic(err)
		}
		fmt.Printf("Connected to zabbix api v%s\n", res)
	}

Run test
You should run tests before using this package â€“ Zabbix API doesn't match documentation in few details, which are changing in patch releases. Tests are not expected to be destructive, but you are advised to run them against not-production instance or at least make a backup.

	export TEST_ZABBIX_URL=http://localhost:8080/zabbix/api_jsonrpc.php
	export TEST_ZABBIX_USER=Admin
	export TEST_ZABBIX_PASSWORD=zabbix
	export TEST_ZABBIX_VERBOSE=1
	go test -v

`TEST_ZABBIX_URL` may contain HTTP basic auth username and password: `http://username:password@host/api_jsonrpc.php`. Also, in some setups URL should be like `http://host/zabbix/api_jsonrpc.php`.
